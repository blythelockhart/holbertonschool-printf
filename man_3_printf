.SH DESCRIPTION
The function
.B _printf()
writes output to stdout under the control of a format
string that specifies how subsequent arguments are
converted for output.
.SS "Format of the format string"
The format string is a character string, beginning and
ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format
string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary
characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the
output stream; and conversion specifications, each of
which results in fetching zero or more subsequent
arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by
the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.
.SS "Conversion specifiers"
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be
applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.BR %%
prints '%' as a character
.TP
.BR %c

.TP
.BR %s
prints a string of characters
.TP
.BR %d ", " %i
